# Welcome to Android Kotlin Boilerplate!

## Getting Started
Android Kotlin Boilerplate refers to standardized methods, procedures and files that may be used over again  for efficiency developing new Android mobile applications.

## What's included
* An Android app with _modular architecture_ and _MVVM_ architectural pattern.
* Splash screen with app version and empty MainActivity.
* Network connectivity interceptor for HTTP requests.
* _Dagger2_ for dependencies injection.
* _ViewBinding_ for activities and fragments.
* _Timber_ for logging purposes.
* Android Studio _EditorConfig_ file to maintain consistent coding styles.
* Gradleâ€™s Kotlin _DSL_.
* _SonarQube_ configuration files.
* _JaCoCo_ maven plugin to generate test coverage reports.
* _ktlint_ for static code analysis.

## Installation
Clone this repository and import it into **Android Studio**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/celerik/android-kotlin-boilerplate.git
```

## Build variants
Herein you can find multiple targets that the app takes into account:

|         |Staging    |Production  |
|---------|-----------|------------|
|Internal |`Debug`    |`Debug`     |
|External |`Release`  |`Release`   |

 Where the following formed variants are built for staging purposes:
- stagingInternalDebug
- stagingInternalRelease

 And these ones for production purposes:
- productionInternalDebug
- productionInternalRelease
- productionExternalDebug
- productionExternalRelease

**_Sidenote:_**  environments with _Internal_ keyword, for example, could set a specific timeout for debug servers, whereas environments with _External_ keyword could have another timeout according to production servers' features. In the other hand, environments with _Debug_ keyword, could keep a debug logger activated; whereas environments with _Release_ keyword don't.
